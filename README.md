# Assignment #7ab: Age Regulator/Calculator

**This assignment is a webpage that tests and processes the age of its users, and allows them access to a calculator after they meet a certain criteria. View this project at: ```walker.rout.ca**```

## Getting Started With the Project

> This webpage starts of on a screen with a big green button asking the user if they would like to run the program. By clicking on this button, several prompts will appear and ask the user for their information (Name, Age). If the age input is older than 18, they will be granted the ability to use the site's calculator. If one wants to leave the page with the calculator, they just have to click the link at the top that will bring them back to the home page.
